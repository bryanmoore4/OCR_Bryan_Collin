How to run the scripts for dumb, flat-footed buckaroos like Collin:

1. DL the neural_network_for_handwriting
2. change directories into the src sub_directory

--> if you want to run it on the digits from mnist do this:

3. in your Command line write:
   >>> import mnist_loader
   >>> training_data, validation_data, test_data = \
	... mnist_loader.load_data_wrapper()
4. May take like 20-25 seconds
5. then in your command line write:
   >>> import network
   >>> net = network.Network([784, 30, 10])
   >>> net.SGD(training_data, 30, 10, 3.0, test_data=test_data)
6. then each epoch will start printing, and each one corresponds
   to how many digits it got correct so 9528/10000 is 95.28%

--> if you want to run it on the letters from our data do this:

3. 3. in your Command line write:
   >>> import workingextraction
   >>> training_data, validation_data, test_data = \
	... workingextraction.extractfeatures()
4. May take like 20-25 seconds
5. then in your command line write:
   >>> import network
   >>> net = network.Network([12500, 100, 26])
   >>> net.SGD(training_data, 30, 100, 3.0, test_data=test_data)
6. then each epoch will start printing, and each one corresponds
   to how many digits it got correct so obviously there is smtn
   up with a section of my script that I need to figure out.
